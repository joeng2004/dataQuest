    "K Nearest Neighbors or KNN is an an algorithm that can make predictions based on the similarity between different observations. In this project, I used KNN to predict the price of a car based on how similar its features are to those of other cars. Towards this end, I applied various machine learning techniques, such as standardization, feature selection, train-test split, hyperparameter optimization, and k-fold cross validation."

    "If we compare the data type of each column to its contents, several opportunities for data cleaning can be seen. For example, the \"normalized-losses\" feature is listed as an object-type column because it contains both strings and numbers. However, the strings in the column are question marks (?). Rather than being categories, these may be placeholders for missing data. This problem applies to several other columns, not just this one.\n",

    "The graph shows a right-skewed distribution, which means that most of the car prices are low and there are outliers with high prices. When we split the data into training and testing sets, we want each set to have a similar distribution to this.\n",
    "\n",
    "De Cock (2011) provides a helpful suggestion on how to do this. The article says, \"Simply order the original data set by a variable of interest (such as \n",
    "sale price) and select every kth observation to achieve the desired sample size (k=2 for a \n",
    "50/50 split or k=4 for a 75/25 split).\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we want an 80/20 split. One-fifth of the data will go to the testing set, so we can use k = 5. We will thus order the observations by price, then assign every 5th observation to the testing set. All other observations will go to the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code below, I have written a custom function `stratify_continuous` that uses this technique. I then performed a train-test split after stratification. `X_train` and `y_train` refer to the features and target in the training set, respectively. `X_test` and `y_test` are from the testing set."

    "## Hyperparameter Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "The fourth technique is hyperparameter optimization. This involves training the KNN model using different hyperparameter values to see which one performs the best.\n",
    "\n",
    "A hyperparameter is a value that influences the behavior of a model and has no relation to the data. In the case of KNN, one important hyperparameter is the $k$ value, or the number of neighbors used to make a prediction. If $k = 5$, we take the mean price of the top five most similar cars and call this our prediction. However, if $k = 10$, we take the top ten cars, so the mean price may be different.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can optimize $k$ in this way:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decide values of $k$ to test.\n",
    "- For each $k$ value, fit and evaluate a KNN model.\n",
    "- Identify the best-performing model and use its $k$ value in the final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to evaluate a model, we need an evaluation metric. In our case, we will use the Root Mean Squared Error or RMSE. This is calculated with the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$RMSE = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (\\text{actual}_i - \\text{predicted}_i)^2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "- $n$ is the sample size.\n",
    "- $\\text{actual}$ is the actual target value, or in this case, the actual price of a car.\n",
    "- $\\text{predicted}$ is the predicted target value.\n",
    "\n",
    "RMSE can be interpreted as the average error of a regression model. For example, if $RMSE = 1000$, this means that the model's predicted car prices are USD 1000 away from the actual car prices, on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example of hyperparameter optimization using RMSE. All of the numeric features were used for this example."

    "The last technique that will be discussed is K-Fold Cross-Validation. Earlier, we split the data into one training set and one testing set. The K-Fold Cross-Validation allows us to obtain a more holistic view of model performance by rotating the observations used in the two sets. In the words of Brownlee (2018), it estimates \"how the model is expected to perform in general when used to make predictions on data not used during the training of the model.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $k$ has a different meaning. It determines the number of splits to make in a dataset. For example, if $k = 5$, the dataset will be split into 5 folds, each set containing 20% of the total data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the following steps are performed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Split the data into 5 folds: A, B, C, D, E.\n",
    "- Use fold A as the testing set and use the others as the training set.\n",
    "- Fit and evaluate a KNN model, thus obtaining RMSE.\n",
    "- Repeat the above process for a total of 5 times, so that each fold is used as a testing set once.\n",
    "- Compile a list of the five RMSE values obtained.\n",
    "- Compute the mean RMSE value. This is the final metric of model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "K-Fold Cross-Validation can be implemented using scikit-learn's `KFold` and `cross_val_score` . An example of 5-fold cross-validation is shown below."

    "The table above shows the ten models with the lowest mean RMSE. Interestingly, the best-performing model had 8 features and a k-value of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its RMSE was 2468, so on average, the predicted prices were USD 2468 off from the actual prices. This is decent considering that the car prices mostly fall between USD 5000 and USD 20000, though it could be better.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SD RMSE is around 355. This means that the RMSE values usually varied by 355 from the mean. This is relatively low compared to the SD RMSE values of the other best-performing models, which range from 350 to over 800. Therefore, the model performance was consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the following concerns are worth noting:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The number of features is somewhat large, and this may be a problem because it can cause overfitting. This means that the model may be too sensitive to small but meaningless variations in the training data. It may be unable to recognize *general trends* properly. However, reducing the number of features may increase the mean RMSE.\n",
    "- The k-value is concerning because only one neighbor is considered when predicting a car's price. I would prefer to have $k > 1$ so that multiple neighbors are taken into consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Personally, I am fine with selecting this model as the final one to use, simply because its mean RMSE is a few hundred dollars lower than that of the other good models. In a real-world scenario, after I implement this model, I would see if it continued to perform well on new data, and then reduce its number of features or increase its k-value if needed."
